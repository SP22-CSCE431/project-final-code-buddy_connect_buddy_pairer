    <h2>Admins</h2>
    <h4>Usage Suggestion</h4>
    <p>
    As an administrator, you have access to the information of all users as well as the ability to initiate the matching process. Once the matching process is ready to be run,
    navigate to the Users page and click "Lets Match" </br>
    In order to have future users become admins, only current admins will be able to switch those privileges. An admin can edit the profile of a
    specific user in order for them to become admins. Without an admin making the change on the user profile, a specific user can't become an admin. 
    An admin should always be set as an officer, but not all officers are considered to be admins.
    The main difference here is that admins have extra access to all the users in Buddy Connect, as well as all the groups, posts, comments, etc.

    <h4>Maintenance Guide</h4>
    <p>You can find the support manual at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TFG5FN15L89nH8-ZQCU6m4uLB_osriOF4VaVg32Ju_o/edit?usp=sharing</p>

    <h2>Officers</h2>
    <h4>Usage Suggestion</h4>
    <p>
    Officers will have access to all the profiles of the members of their group. They should be able to edit their group and also leave
    comments on any post on the forum, as well as delete posts that may be inappropriate. Although administrators should be the only ones who need to access the support guide,
    it can be found at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TFG5FN15L89nH8-ZQCU6m4uLB_osriOF4VaVg32Ju_o/edit?usp=sharing.

    <h2>Users</h2>
    <p>
    Welcome to BuddyConnect! Once you have been assigned to your group, there will be a group tab appearing near the top of your screen. You should
    be able to see the phone numbers of other members of your group, as well as your officer's profile. The rest of the officers will be in the Users
    tab. The forum is available for anyone to post, so feel free to leave any questions!
